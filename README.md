# Task 2: Singleton Implementation

## Student Info
- Name: Lucas Dyer
- ID: 01224289

## Pattern: Singleton
### Implementation
I decided to use heavy inspiraiton of the code we were using in class. There was some edits that needed, to be made, functionality to be added, and much more, but some of the code is still largely the same. Using that as a basis I recreated the shooter game we worked on in class. The big change I implemented was the main title screen, scene changes, and the addition of more bullets as your score increases.
